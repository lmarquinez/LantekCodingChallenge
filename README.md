The task is to create an application that displays the existing cutting machines. The list of cutting machines must be obtained by querying the above API. The following information should be displayed for each machine:
- Name
- Manufacturer

## Technical questions

1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

2. What was the most useful feature added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
